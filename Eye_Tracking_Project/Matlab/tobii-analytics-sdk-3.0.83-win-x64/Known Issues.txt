- .Net sample precompiled files are not signed. This will cause a information dialog to appear on newer versions of Windows. 
  We recommend that you select the option not to show this message again.

- Path to Qt SDK might be erroneous on Mac OS X as directory structure have changed between versions of Qt. 
  Please compare path defined in make file with your installation of Qt.

- Naming conventions are not consistent in Python bindings.

- In some dialogs of QtSample and EyetrackerBrowser, text is larger than text box (on Linux and Mac OSX).

- EyetrackerBrowser executable for Windows is not signed. This will cause a information dialog to appear on newer versions of Windows. 
  We recommend that you select the option not to show this message again.

- On OS X, Eyetracker Browser does allow upgrade ET to the same FW version as already installed.  
  
- If you have many eyetrackers on the same network, listing of eyetrackers can be very slow on Mac OS X.

- The calibration screen in "qteyetrackingsample" (C++ sample) should be shown in full screen - but is shown in windowed mode on Ubuntu 12.04.
