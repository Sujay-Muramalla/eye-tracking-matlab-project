Change Blindness

Simple change blindness experiment using a flicker paradigm.  You have the option of adding a text item to each trial (the text will appear just before the flicker sequence on each trial).



To modify the code for your experiment:

Put your images in the images folder.  Your results will be saved in the results folder.

If you want to include text in your experiment, replace the text file with your own list of text items.  The code assumes that the text file and images are in the same order (line 1 of the text file will appear on the same trial as the first image, line 2 with the second image, etc.).  To ensure that the text appears with the right image, I strongly recommend that you start each image file name with a number.

Modify the settings in the file settingsImageSequence.m to suit your experiment.
